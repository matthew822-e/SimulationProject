# SimulationProject
The Simulation is a Java program that uses a self-built dynamic array data structure to run a simulation of water, sand, and metal. These elements have property's and interact with each other on a small, pixelated GUI. The GUI is created by a 2D dynamic array that holds the elements and allows them to move from array to array creating a simulation of basic physics between water, sand, and metal.    

To run this simulation run Simulation.java file. If everything is correct a GUI will show up the screen. 
This screen is resizable but is recommended to keep it as the default size because enlarging the GUI will drastically decrease the speed of the simulation.
 
 - On the right side of the screen are option including Empty, Metal, Sand, Water, and debug.
 - click on one and click in the pixelated screen.
 - As you see elements will appear on the GUI and interact with each other based on the programs physics.

# SimulationProject
Java program that uses self built dynamic array data structure to run a simulation of water, sand, and metal. These element have property's and interact with each other on a small pixelated GUI.  

When running this simulation a GUI will show up in the screen. 
This screen is resizable but is recommended to keep it as the default size because enlarging the GUI will drastically decrease the speed of the simulation.
 
 - On the right side of the screen are option including Empty, Metal, Sand, Water, and debug.
 - click on one and click in the pixelated screen.
 - As you see they will appear on the GUI and interact with each other based on the programs physics.
